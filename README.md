## ðŸ“ŒÂ Abstract

>Detecting objects in low-light conditions is challenging since the primary features of objects may be buried in dark regions. To tackle this issue, we propose IT-YOLO, an object detector that employs an illumination-aware two-stage enhancement approach. First, an illumination feature extractor is applied to capture the lighting condition of an image. Afterwards, these illumination-related features are utilized to guide both imagelevel and feature-level enhancements in IT-YOLO. With the additional guidance, the image-level enhancement adjusts the lowlight image using an estimated reciprocal curve, while the featurelevel enhancement modulates the multi-scale features extracted by the detection backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that IT-YOLO outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy, while maintaining a low number of parameters and high running speed. Our source code and pre-trained model will be available at https://github.com/bohan301/IT-YOLO.

The codes will be released after our paper is accepted.
